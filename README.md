This project integrates Firebase Authentication with React. If we are logged in, we display a profile page (a sentence) that contains the user's email, which we store using Firebase Auth, as well as the user's name, which we store using Cloud Firestore. We use the the Context API to store the user on the client.  This project has no styling and only contains the very basics: signing up a user, logging in a user, displaying a user profile, and displaying a navigation that is dependent upon whether the user is logged in or logged out.   To see the same project with styling via Materialize, view the repo "FirebaseAuth-React-Materialize".
