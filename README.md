This project integrates Firebase Authentication with React. If we are logged in, we display a profile page (a sentence) that contains the user's email, which we store using Firebase Auth, as well as the user's name, which we store using Cloud Firestore. We use the the Context API to store the user.  This project uses no styling.   To see the same project with styling, view the repo "FirebaseAuth-React-Materialize".
